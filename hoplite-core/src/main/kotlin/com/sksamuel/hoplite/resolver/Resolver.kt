/**
 * A [Resolver] is used to modify a value before the value is applied to a field in a data config class.
 *
 * For example, a resolver may apply substitutions from elsewhere in the tree (see [ReferenceContextResolver]),
 * or apply envvar overrides (see [EnvVarContextResolver]), or it may resolve against a secrets manager
 * such as Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
 *
 * For a full list of out of the box resolvers see project documentation at
